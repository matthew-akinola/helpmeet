## About the project

Help line is a mobile Emergency application. It connects Estate Residents and Estate Admin together.
In case of robbery, health Emergency case or domestic fire outbreak, a user can turn on the button on the app
which will send an alarm or notification to all users connected on the app to either come to aid or call the authority.
The app will also display the address of the patient or victim via the estate map
